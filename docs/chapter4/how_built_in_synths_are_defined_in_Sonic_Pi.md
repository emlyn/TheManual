# Chapter 4 - How built-in synths are defined in Sonic Pi

## Philosophy

One of the working philosophies of Sonic Pi is that the tech shouldn't get in the way of experimentation.

All the built-in synths share common parameters - some have additional parameters. The idea is that if you have some running code (or are live coding) and you swap out one synth for another then bad things SHOULDN'T happen - it should behave much as you expected and not in a surprising way.

This section is going to look at [synthinfo.rb](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/710107fe22c5977b9fa5e83b71e30f847610e240/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/synths/synthinfo.rb).

## BaseInfo

All synthesiser objects inherit from the base class `BaseInfo` mostly by the chain of indirection: `SonicPiSynth < SynthInfo < BaseInfo`.

But looking at all the synthesiser classes we see a simple pattern synths come in families and often descend from a common base class.

Note that sometimes synth names are just aliases for each other `sine`/`beep` and `mod_sine`/`mod_beep`. This aliasing happens in the global variable [@@synth_info](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/710107fe22c5977b9fa5e83b71e30f847610e240/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/synths/synthinfo.rb#L8118).

To be recognised as a synth you need to be added to the global variable `@@synth_infos` in `synthinfo.rb`.

We can tell what functions are designed to be implemented in the sub-classes by looking for base class members that will blow up if they are not. Examining the [code](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/710107fe22c5977b9fa5e83b71e30f847610e240/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/synths/synthinfo.rb#L81) we see:

```ruby
      def doc
        "Please write documentation!"
      end

      def arg_defaults
        raise "please implement arg_defaults for #{self.class}"
      end

      def name
        raise "please implement name for synth info: #{self.class}"
      end

      def category
        raise "please implement category for synth info: #{self.class}"
      end

      def prefix
        ""
      end

      def synth_name
        raise "Please implement synth_name for #{self.class}"
      end

      def introduced
        raise "please implement introduced version for synth info: #{self.class}"
      end

      def trigger_with_logical_clock?
        raise "please implement trigger_with_logical_clock? for synth info: #{self.class}"
      end
```

Lets go through them one by one.

### function doc

This function is called when the displaying the gui. If we go to [the `doc` function for the `beeb` synth](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/710107fe22c5977b9fa5e83b71e30f847610e240/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/synths/synthinfo.rb#L805) and edit it to:

```ruby
      def doc
        "A simple pure sine wave, yowza. The sine wave is the simplest, purest sound there is and is the fundamental building block of all noise. The mathematician Fourier demonstrated that any sound could be built out of a number of sine waves (the more complex the sound, the more sine waves needed). Have a play combining a number of sine waves to design your own sounds!"
      end
```

This function is called during the compile process (not at run time) and is used to generate the entry about the synth in the gui.

The functions you must add are:
* name
* introduced
* synth_name
* doc

In addition synths commonly add the functions `art_defaults` and `specific_arg_info`.

The base class broadly defines a well-behaved Sonic Pi synth, particularly in the function [default_arg_info](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/710107fe22c5977b9fa5e83b71e30f847610e240/app/server/ruby/lib/sonicpi/synths/synthinfo.rb#L329) which defines a complete set of arguments most built-in synthesisers accept.
