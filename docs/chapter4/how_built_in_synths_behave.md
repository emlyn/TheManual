# Chapter 4 - How built-in synths behave

## Philosophy

One of the working philosophies of Sonic Pi is that the tech shouldn't get in the way of experimentation.

All the built-in synths share common parameters - some have additional parameters. The idea is that if you have some running code (or are live coding) and you swap out one synth for another then bad things SHOULDN'T happen - it should behave much as you expected and not in a surprising way.
