# Chapter 5 - Recreating the beep synth

## Compile errors

There are a number of common errors you might see.

### You haven't started the server

```supercollider
WARNING: server 'localhost' not running.
```

If you see this, you are trying to do things in the SuperCollider REPL but haven't started the server. You can use the menu command `Server -> Boot Server` to do it.

Or conventionally you can set the variable `s` to the server and invoke methods on it:

```supercollider
=Server.local;

s.boot;

s.quit;
```

(it's only a convention, can use any variable here...)

### Wrong file name error

If you get the error ending in:

```supercollider
^^ The preceding error dump is for ERROR: Primitive '_FilePutString' failed.
Failed.
RECEIVER: a File
```

You didn't edit the file name in the synth def and it can't save the compiled output

```supercollider
}).writeDefFile("/Users/gordonguthrie/.synthdefs"))
```
