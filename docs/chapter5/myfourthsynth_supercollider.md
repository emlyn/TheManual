## Chapter 5 - Recreating the beep Synth

A simple beep synthesiser - fourth and final version

This synth accepts the following parameters:

* `note` a midi note
* `note_slide` the time in beats it takes for a note to change when controlling a synth (0 means a step change)
* `note_slide_shape` the shape of the transition of the note
* `note_slide_curve` for custom shapes whether the transition curves up or down
* `pan` a location to pan to (between -1.0 and 1.0)
* `pan_slide` - like `note_slide` but for `pan`
* `pan_slide_shape` - like `note_slide_shape` but for `pan`
* `pan_slide_curve` - like `note_slide_curve` but for `pan`
* `amp` a volume (0.0 to 1.0)
* `amp_slide` - like `note_slide` but for `amp`
* `amp_slide_shape` - like `note_slide_shape` but for `amp`
* `amp_slide_curve` - like `note_slide_curve` but for `amp`
* `attack` amount of time for sound to build up to full amplitude
* `decay` amount of time for sound to move from the attack to the sustain level
* `sustain` amount of time the sound is sustained
* `release` amount of time for sound to go from the sustained level to 0
* `attack_level` sound level at attack phase
* `decay_level` sound level in decay phase
* `sustain_level` sound level in sustain phase
* `env_curve` shape of the curve of volume transition


```supercollider
(SynthDef("myfourthsynth", {arg out = 0, note = 52.0, note_slide = 0, note_slide_shape = 1, note_slide_curve = 0, amp = 1, amp_slide = 0, amp_slide_shape = 1, amp_slide_curve = 0, pan = 0, pan_slide = 0, pan_slide_shape = 1, pan_slide_curve = 0;
```

define the variables that we will use later

```supercollider
    var snd, env, freq, slid_note, slid_amp, slid_pan;
```

set up an envelope that kills the sound after 1 second

```supercollider
	env = Line.kr(0.1, 0.0, 1.0, doneAction: 2);
```

slide the note

```supercollider
	slid_note = VarLag.kr(note, note_slide, note_slide_curve, note_slide_shape);
	slid_amp = VarLag.kr(amp, amp_slide, amp_slide_curve, amp_slide_shape);
	slid_pan = VarLag.kr(pan, pan_slide, pan_slide_curve, pan_slide_shape);
```

convert the midi note to frequency

```supercollider
	freq = midicps(slid_note);
```

get a beep from the Sin Oscillator and then place it in the Pan
and set the volume

```supercollider
	snd = Pan2.ar(SinOsc.ar(freq, 0, env), pos: slid_pan, level: slid_amp);
```

play

```supercollider
	Out.ar(out, snd)
}).writeDefFile("/Users/gordonguthrie/.synthdefs"))
```
