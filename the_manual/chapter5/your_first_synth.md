# Chapter 5 - Recreating the beep synth

## Your first synth

Where to start?

Start with the [Sonic Pi synths written in SuperCollider](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/tree/dev/etc/synthdefs/designs/supercollider)

SuperCollider itself has [comprehensive documentation](https://doc.sccode.org/) which includes a big set of tutorials.

There are [lots](https://github.com/loopier/synthdefs) [of](https://github.com/SCLOrkHub/SCLOrkSynths) [different](http://sccode.org/1-5aD) [open source](https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/SynthDefPool) [synths](http://sccode.org/) written for SuperCollider. These you will have to adapt to work with Sonic Pi (if you want them to be well behaved).

If you find any, add them.

We can add your synths to this manual too! (see the Next Steps).
